A few Microsoft Sql scripts for different tasks like backup, dbcc related stuff, deadlock discovery, transaction locks reviews etc.

Feel free to use and modify them for your purposes.
Please include any modifications in the original codebase where applicable.

Scripts are compatible with Microsoft Sql Server 2005 and higher.

I wrote most of them and left credit to an original author where needed; credit is left where credit is due.
